## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project, the most satisfying part to practice was the style manipulation with JavaScript, because I have used DOM before, but only for HTML.


### Useful resources

- [Curso em Video](https://www.cursoemvideo.com/curso/javascript/) - This was my kickstart on JS. A 40 hour basic course.
